Here are the revised game action for Tray to animate.

Two of them changed:
1. Toilet to Tap became Gray Water (all new)
2. New Laws became Legal Action (new text only)

I'm attaching the outlined version for Tray as well as the editable AI version for Enspire.
p.s. Jason — just to be clear — the light bulb in "Teach People" was just for Tray to animate (the waterdrop might become a lightbulb) and it's not to be a part of the icon for the wheel spinner.
